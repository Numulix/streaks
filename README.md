# Streaks - A Modern Habit Tracker

**Streaks** is a full-stack web application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits. It provides a clean, interactive interface for tracking daily progress, visualizing consistency over time, and staying motivated by maintaining streaks.

This project was built to master the frontend full-stack TypeScript ecosystem, leveraging the power of Next.js App Router, server-side data fetching, and a seamless developer experience with a fully integrated toolchain.
